# NesMachine

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77c883a1-3e3c-4479-bb54-0ef95a6fa8c7)

Personal NES emulator for the purpose of learning how computers work.

Currently being rewritten from scratch; I wasn't very good when I wrote the first iteration.

> [!NOTE]  
> At the moment it can only load NROM-based games. Other cartridge types may or may not get support (MMC1 carts are planned because I want to play Metroid).
> 
> See this list for games that should load: https://nesdir.github.io/mapper0.html
